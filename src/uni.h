/*
 * uni.h -- Unicode text layer for plain PM applications
 *
 * Strings are kept as UTF-8 (code page 1208), exactly as they come from the
 * language files.  GPI draws them directly: the logical font is created with
 * usCodePage = 1208 and GpiSetCp(hps, 1208), and the length arguments are in
 * BYTES.  No conversion to UCS-2 is needed for drawing.  Everything PM cannot
 * display natively (menus, title bar) goes through ULS conversion into the
 * process code page or through owner drawing.
 *
 * Findings from probe\probe.c and probe\probe1208.c on ArcaOS 5.1
 * (documented in README.md):
 *   - a font created with code page 1208 draws UTF-8 text identically to the
 *     same text as UCS-2 in code page 1200 (the font's code page decides,
 *     GpiSetCp on a font created for 1200 does not work)
 *   - "Droid Sans Combined", "Times New Roman MT 30" and the WT J fonts
 *     contain Kana, Kanji/Hanzi and Hangul glyphs
